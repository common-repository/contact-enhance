== Description ==

This plugin works with Contact Form 7 to enhance the business data you collect with a variety of fields including company name, revenue, company description and many more available from daashub.io.

If you generate enquiries using Contact Form 7 but only collect the absolute minimum then this plugin is for you.  With Contact Enhance we check in realtime against our Db for a business match then enhance your enquiry with publicly available business information such as the full company name and registered address.

Please note that data plans are available from daashub.io including our basic plan with up to 50 free data credits per month.

With Contact Enhance you can run more targeted campaigns based on Standard Industry Classification and Postcode and identify big opportunities based on revenue - just as two examples.

Please note that no personal information is sent using Contact Enhance
